The code in this branch is based on the OS X iprogram iTerm.

Heres is a rough plan for this branch:
- Get scrolling working properly
- Get Fix bugs, clean up all the tons of commented out features of iTerm that
we never plan to support
- Speed it up, use less CPU
- use gestures for arrow keys (swipe up, down, left, right, etc)
- Merge back into the main brach (e.g. support keyboard hiding again)
- Continue on other features such as "<esc>", etc.
